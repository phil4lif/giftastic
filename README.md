On this website the user is able to click on any of the default buttons to display 10 gifs of a wild animal from the giphy api.

The gifs default image is still, but the user can click the image to animate the gif, and then click again to stop it.  

The user may also add a button of their own by typing in the form and submitting, then they may click on the new button that they've created to load gifs of that animal.
